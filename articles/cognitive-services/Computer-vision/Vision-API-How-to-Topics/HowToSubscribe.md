## Obtaining Subscription Keys
Every call to the Computer Vision API requires a subscription key. This key needs to be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header. 

To sign up for subscription keys, see [Subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). It's free to sign up. Pricing for these services is subject to change. 

To get the key (which will work with the code):
- Open portal.azure.com
- Add new service by clicking on the + sign
- After you add the service, click on it
- Now you will see a menu item __Keys__ under __RESOURCE MANAGEMENT__
- This is the key you need. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Free subscriptions that are not used for 90 days consecutively may expire. However, if your subscription expires you can request new keys.
